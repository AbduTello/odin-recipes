        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Gruyère cheese (or substitute with more cheddar if desired)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for a subtle kick)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs (for the crunchy topping)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter or cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Cook the elbow macaroni according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 1/4 cup of unsalted butter. Stir in the flour and cook for about 1 minute, whisking constantly to create a roux.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the whole milk while whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Cook the mixture until it thickens and starts to simmer.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the shredded cheddar and Gruyère cheeses, along with the grated Parmesan cheese. Mix until the cheeses melt completely and the sauce becomes smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Add the Dijon mustard and cayenne pepper (if using) to the cheese sauce, and season with salt and black pepper to taste. Stir well to incorporate all the flavors.</li>
        <li>Combine the cooked macaroni with the cheese sauce, ensuring that all the noodles are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Pour the macaroni and cheese mixture into the greased baking dish, spreading it out evenly.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the panko breadcrumbs with the melted butter, combining them thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the buttered breadcrumbs evenly over the top of the macaroni and cheese, creating a crunchy and irresistible topping.</li>
        <li>Bake the mac and cheese in the preheated oven for approximately 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Remove the dish from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving to allow the sauce to set slightly.</li>
        <li>Serve the Creamy Baked Macaroni and Cheese while it's still warm, and enjoy the gooey, cheesy goodness with friends and family. </li>
