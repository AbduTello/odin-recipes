        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>Zest of one lemon</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh dill, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Lemon slices (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Rinse the salmon fillets under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. Place the fillets on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each one.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, fresh lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, chopped parsley, dill, and thyme. Season the mixture with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Pour the lemon-herb marinade over the salmon fillets, making sure to coat them evenly. You can use a brush or spoon to spread the marinade if needed.</li>
        <li>Allow the salmon to marinate in the refrigerator for about 20-30 minutes to enhance the flavors.</li>
        <li>After marinating, place the baking sheet with the salmon in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 12-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets. The salmon should be cooked through but still moist and tender.</li>
        <li>Once the salmon is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a minute or two.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the salmon fillets to serving plates. Garnish each fillet with a lemon slice for an extra burst of citrusy flavor.</li>
        <li>Serve the Baked Salmon with Lemon and Herbs alongside your favorite side dishes, such as roasted vegetables, rice pilaf, or a fresh green salad.</li>
