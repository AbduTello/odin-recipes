    For the crust:
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    for the filling:
    <ul>
        <li>4 packages (32 ounces) cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>Zest of one lemon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C) and grease a 9-inch springform pan with butter or cooking spray.</li>
        <li>For the crust, in a medium-sized bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup of granulated sugar, and melted butter. Stir until the mixture resembles wet sand. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of the prepared springform pan, creating an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake the crust in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and 1 1/2 cups of granulated sugar until smooth and creamy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Incorporate the sour cream, vanilla extract, lemon juice, and lemon zest into the cream cheese mixture. Mix until all the ingredients are fully combined and the filling is velvety smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling over the cooled crust in the springform pan, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li>Place the springform pan in a larger roasting pan and fill the roasting pan with hot water until it reaches about halfway up the sides of the springform pan. This water bath will help ensure even baking and prevent cracks.</li>
        <li>Bake the cheesecake in the water bath for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes or until the edges are set, and the center is slightly wobbly.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and crack the oven door open. Let the cheesecake cool in the oven for about an hour.</li>
        <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and allow it to cool completely at room temperature. Once cooled, cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the cheesecake to set.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, gently remove the sides of the springform pan and transfer the cheesecake to a serving plate.</li>
        <li>Slice the Classic New York-Style Cheesecake into generous portions and serve with fresh berries or a drizzle of raspberry coulis for an extra touch of elegance. Enjoy this heavenly dessert that's sure to delight everyone's taste buds!</li>
